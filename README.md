# Cogi234's Minecraft rebalance

A fabric mod to rebalance minecraft for my personal game.

What it does:
- Disable beds setting spawn and skipping night
- Enable respawn anchors in the overworld
- Rework phantoms so they spawn less, but spawn at night regardless of sleep.
- Disable anvil costs accumulating
- Make anvil repairs cost only one material
- You can't combine enchants to increase their levels anymore
- Make mending and unbreaking mutually exclusive
- The enchanting table now has the same levels on all three slots, and a max level of 20 instead of 30.
- Rebalance all loot enchants to reward exploring structures
- Make villages somewhat rarer
- Increase minecart speed

This can all be changed in the config.
